## This project is intended for learning purposes.

As such, I intend to slowly rotate through different tech-stacks/layouts.  Due to this constraint, some behaviors/pages won't be implemented (until we're further down the tech-tree and they can be feasibly implemented).  Given below is a list of `things (reasons)` that I probably won't/cannot implement.  I'll keep updating this list as I get more and more familiar with Twitter (I'm not an avid Twitter user).



### Things that I want to implement but cannot currently due to current-build limitations:
* Twitter's on-click modals (No JS).
* Twitter's on-click dropdown menus (No JS).
* Twitter's new-tweet public-reply-restrictor (No JS).

### Things that I probably won't be implementing due to data/cost/time limitations:
* ML algorithm to determine user's preferences (Data [although, I might use twitter's API to circumvent this later])
